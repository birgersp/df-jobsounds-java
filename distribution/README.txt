# [JobSounds](https://github.com/birgersp/df-jobsounds)

A Dwarf Fortress sound utility.

Requires [DFHack](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=139553) and Java.

**How to use**
* Extract the contents of the .zip to your Dwarf Fortress installation folder
* Start Dwarf Fortress
* Run the .jar file (on Windows, you can use the .bat script to run it)
NOTE: If you don't want to copy this utility to your Dwarf Fortress folder, simply extract it somewhere else and enter the Dwarf Fortress directory when you launch the utility. For Windows users, the easiest way is to modify the .bat file by adding the directory at the end of the launch command. For example, you could edit the .bat file to:

@echo off
java -jar df-jobsounds.jar "C:\Dwarf Fortress 0.43.03"
pause
